# Triangle-Drawer-With-Raylib
A Triangle Drawer With Raylib using only the DrawPixel() and window functions for graphics.

FPS is calculated with raylib's DrawFPS(), we draw 20 random triangles per frame. Currently stands at around 10 FPS on my computer(test on your own).

The least efficient part is the triangle filling part which I know can be improved, but I don't know how.
